# Collecting videos with ORBIT

## Choosing your things

Your first task is to decide what you would like the AI to learn about. To do this, you should choose three things that are important to you. They can be items you regularly need to find or identify, items that easily get misplaced, or items that are difficult to identify by touch alone. You should select three things, each a different size: one small, one medium and one large or immobile thing. 

1. The small thing can be your mug, your keys, your headphones, or anything smaller than the distance from your elbow to your fingertips. 
2.	The medium thing can be your backpack, your unfolded guide cane or anything bigger than the distance from your elbow to your fingertips.
3.	The large or immobile thing can be your friend’s front door, your car, a setting in your washing machine, or any other item that you cannot easily move.

## Choosing where to record 

Your next task is to choose at least two different places where you will record the training videos for the things you can move around. It is important that each of these locations is different so that the app can learn to recognise your things when they are in different places! This can mean surfaces in different rooms of your house or in a public space like a library, in different corners of the same room, in outdoor locations like your garden or garage, in indoor locations with a lot of natural light like near a window, or in locations with no natural light at all, like a cupboard. 

It is okay if you reuse locations and record a training video of one thing on the same surface as the training video of another thing. What is important is that you do not record multiple training videos of the same thing in the same environment. If your things can be easily moved, you can speed up the process by taking several things at once to one location and then taking a training video of each separately before moving them all to the next environment.

If the items you choose cannot be moved to different environments because they are too large or they are immoveable, don’t worry. We’ll give you specific instructions for how to deal with these items.

## Recording videos with ORBIT

Once you have chosen your things and identified your surfaces and locations, you are ready to start recording your videos! You will record two types of videos of your things - training and testing videos.

### Training videos

Let’s first talk about training videos. Let’s say you want your recognition app to recognise your keys. First, the AI needs to be taught what your keys look like, so you will need to record several training videos of your keys. Importantly, your training videos must meet three criteria:

1.	Each training video should record only one thing at a time. There should be no other objects in the background or on the same surface as the keys. 
2.	Each training video must show the keys in a different setting. For example, you might take one training video when the keys are on a kitchen counter, one when they have dropped on the floor, one when they are on the couch, etc.
3.	Each training video must include views of the keys from different sides.  You will need to think about what parts of the keys are the most identifiable. Do they have a keyring with a particular shape or colour? Maybe you have a whistle on the ring as well. The training video should capture these important parts of the object. 

Let’s get started!

Select one of the three things you’ve chosen to record. If your thing is small-to-medium sized, see the next section on [Training videos for small/medium things](#training-videos-for-smallmedium-things). If your thing is larger or cannot be moved, see the section after that, [Training videos for large or immobile things](#training-videos-for-large-or-immobile-things). You will need to record videos for each of your things in two different environments. 

#### Training videos for small/medium things

Step-by-step instructions on how to record a training video of a small to medium sized item that you can move around:

##### Step 1. Go to your selected environment.

Go to where you want to film your thing and clear it so nothing else is on the surface.

##### Step 2. Position your thing on the clear surface.

Place your thing on the surface, about an arm’s length away from you. Placing the object an arm’s length away will help you keep it in frame when filming.

##### Step 3. Open the camera app on your phone.  

Find the camera application on your phone and be ready to take a video.

##### Step 4. Record a video. 

Place one hand on the surface just next to your thing. This hand will be your anchor point and you should try to point the lens on the back of your phone towards this anchor while recording. Hold your phone in the other hand and bring it as close as possible to your item as if you wanted to film it from a very close view. Click the “Record” button to begin recording the video. Keep your anchor hand on the surface and counting slowly to 5 slowly draw your phone away in a straight line from your thing until your phone reaches your body. Once your phone touches your body, rotate the item on the surface so that a different side of it is facing you. Bring your phone back to the item and as close to it as possible. Repeat the slow drawing out motion with your phone until it reaches your body. Repeat this for two more sides of the item, each time rotating the item, so a new side is facing you. Click the “Stop” button to end your recording. 

#### Training videos for large or immobile things

Step-by-step instructions on how to record a training video of a large sized or immovable item:

If your thing is large or immobile, you might not be able to rotate it or move it to different places to record your videos. Therefore, you will have to take all these training videos in one place, but rather than rotating your item around on a surface, you will move yourself around your large or immovable item. You will record multiple videos, each taken from a different position or angle facing your thing. 

If your thing is large but easy to move around, you will take multiple videos of it in two different environments as you did with your small items but this time using the following technique.

##### Step 1. Go to your selected environment. 

Go to where you want to film your thing and clear it so nothing else is on the surface.

##### Step 2. Determine three different positions that face your large or immovable thing. 

A door is much larger than a set of keys, but like the keys, certain parts of the door make it recognisable as this specific door. Take a few seconds to identify three important parts of your large or immovable thing. If your thing does not have three parts that are physically separate, for example a wall plug or a setting on your washing machine, simply choose three different angles to face your thing. For example, one facing it directly, another facing it from two steps to the left, and another from two steps to the right. Videos that show your thing from different angles will be useful for the recognition app to learn to recognise it.

##### Step 3. Open the camera app on your phone.

Find the camera application on your phone and be ready to take a video.

##### Step 4.  Record a video from position one. 

Start by facing your item’s first important part. Reach out and place one hand near this part. If your thing doesn’t have physically separate parts, simply face your thing from the first angle you identified and place a hand near or on your thing. This hand will be your first anchor point. You should try to point the lens on the back of your phone towards this anchor point while recording. Hold your phone in the other hand and bring it as close as possible to your anchor point. Click the “Record” button to begin recording the video. Keeping your hand on or next to your thing, count slowly to 5  while drawing your phone away from that anchor point in a straight line until it reaches your body. Now, keeping your phone steady against your body, take two small steps backwards if it is safe to do so. Click the “Stop” button to end your recording.

##### Step 5. Repeat recording from position two, and then from position three.

### Testing videos

Now let’s talk about testing videos. We call these testing videos because we will use them to test our AI algorithms to see how well they are working in real-life scenarios. To do this, you will need to place each of your things on a surface where there are at least five other objects and then take a video of the whole scene. This will help us test the AI to see if it can find and recognise your things in a more realistic setting.

Because we want this to be as realistic as possible, you will need to record a video of your thing on a surface where you commonly look for it.  You will need to construct a realistic scene by arranging your thing and at least five other objects on this same surface. This might be tricky sometimes but try to do your best to make it as realistic as possible. These other objects could be some of your three things or completely different items. For immovable objects like your front door, try to position some likely objects around it, such as packages, umbrellas, or shoes. When you are arranging your scene, try to match how someone else, who doesn’t know your habits, might arrange your thing with the other objects. Remember, the more realistic your arrangement of different objects together with your thing, the better. The point is to create a realistic scene where we can test if the app would find your thing even with other stuff around it. 

There are two kinds of testing videos: “zoom out” and “pan”.

#### How to record a zoom out testing video

The first type of testing video is called “zoom out” testing video and uses a similar technique to the training videos. You will need take one zoom out testing video for each of your three things.

##### Step 1. Select one of your things.

##### Step 2. Find an environment to record your video. 

Go to a surface or location where you would regularly place or look for your thing. For immovable things go to the location where your item is.

##### Step 3. Construct a realistic scene with your thing and other objects. 

For more information on how this scene should look, read the section above on arranging the scene with other objects.

##### Step 4. Open the camera app on your phone.  

Find the camera application on your phone and be ready to take a video.

##### Step 5. Record a video of your scene. 

Start by facing your scene. Try to make sure your selected thing is not directly in front of you. We are interested to film the whole scene and not just your thing. Now, reach out and place one hand in your scene. If your scene is on a surface, place your hand on the edge of the surface. If your scene contains a larger or immovable thing, place your hand somewhere on that item. This hand will be your anchor point and you should try to point the lens on the back of your phone towards this anchor while recording. Holding your phone in your other hand, bring your phone as close as possible to your anchor point with the camera pointed towards your scene. Click the “Record” button to begin recording the video. Now, keeping your anchor hand fixed, slowly draw your phone toward you and away from that anchor point until it reaches your body.  Now, keeping your phone steady against your body, take 2 small steps backwards. Once you have reached your body, click the “Stop” button to end your recording. 

Repeat these five steps for each of your three things!

#### How to record a ‘pan‘ testing video

The second type of testing video is called a scanning testing video. You will need to take one scanning testing video for each of your 3 things.

##### Step 1. Select one of your things.

##### Step 2. Find an environment to record your video. 

Go to a surface or location where you would regularly place or look for your thing. For immovable things, go to the location where your item is.

##### Step 3. Construct a realistic scene with your thing and other objects. 

For more information on how this scene should look, read the section above on arranging the scene with other objects.

##### Step 4. Open the camera app on your phone.  

Find the camera application on your phone and be ready to take a video.

##### Step 5. Record a video of your scene. 

Start by facing your scene. Try to make sure your selected thing is not directly in front of you. You will now record a video while panning over this scene from right to left. Start by holding your phone pointing to your scene. Move your arm to the right so that your camera’s lens is pointing toward the right edge of your scene. This could be the right edge of your surface or the right edge of your larger item. Click the “Record” button to begin recording the video. Now, slowly pan your phone to the left edge of your scene as if you were scanning over the surface searching for your item. Try to keep your phone steady as you move it in a straight line from the right to the left edge of the scene. Remember, in a real-life situation, the app will not know where your thing is, so do not give it any hints by zooming in or stopping the camera when you pan over your thing. When you reach the left edge of your scene, click the “Stop” button to end your recording.

Repeat these five steps for each of your three things!
