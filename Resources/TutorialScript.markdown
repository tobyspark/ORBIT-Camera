# Introduction

Hello and welcome to the ORBIT dataset project! 

We are collecting a dataset to help develop AI recognition apps that will use your mobile phone's camera to find and identify the things that are important to you. For example, has someone moved your house keys? Do you regularly need to identify specific items while out shopping? What about your guide cane - have you forgotten where you put it, or gotten it confused with someone else’s? Maybe you want to recognise the door of a friend’s house? Imagine if you did not have to know exactly where your things were in order to find or identify them again. 

To build these recognition apps, a large dataset of videos taken by blind and visually impaired users is needed. As part of the ORBIT dataset project, you will be asked to take multiple videos of at least ten things that are meaningful to you or that you regularly need to find or identify. We will combine these videos with submissions from other ORBIT contributors to form a large dataset of different objects. This dataset can then be used to develop new AI algorithms to help build apps that will work for blind and visually impaired users all over the world. 

This document includes step-by-step instructions for how to use this app to record videos of different objects in a way that will help us build new AI systems. Because taking videos that can be used for developing AI can be tricky for blind users, these instructions are fairly detailed. Please read them carefully and feel free to revisit the different sections of this guide as often as you need.

## How does AI work?  

Before you begin taking videos, it might help to understand how they will be used. Apps like Seeing AI use Artificial Intelligence, or AI, to automatically recognise the things users shot with their phone camera. To do this, these systems have to be “taught” what to look for by analysing images or videos of things you want to recognise. This is called training the AI. By collecting different examples of an object taken with different views and contexts, you teach the AI what is important and what can be ignored. This is similar to teaching a child a new word by repeating it in different ways. 

However, we also need to measure how well the AI works by seeing how it handles new images that it wasn’t trained on in real-life scenarios. This is called testing the AI. It’s not helpful if the AI works perfectly for identifying your keys sitting on a table by themselves but not when they are next to a phone or cutlery! So, we need to have different videos of objects for training and testing the AI. 

The ORBIT app is designed to collect both training and testing videos. These instructions should help you to record videos that will be used for both purposes. 

# Collecting videos with ORBIT

## Choosing your things

Your first task is to decide what you would like the AI to learn about. To do this, you should choose at least ten things that are important to you. They can be items you regularly need to find or identify, items that easily get misplaced, or items that are difficult to identify by touch alone. For example, your house keys, your backpack, a tin of food, your guide cane, or a wristwatch. Also consider large or immobile things that you might want to recognise. For example, a friend’s door, a car, a colleagues' desk, a specific setting on a household appliance, or a wall plug. Of your things, we suggest that at least two of them are large or immobile things. 

## Choosing where to record 

Your next task is to choose at least six different places where you will record the training videos for the things you can move around. It is important that each of these locations is different so that the app can learn to recognise your things when they are in different places! This can mean surfaces in different rooms of your house or in a public space like a library, in different corners of the same room, in outdoor locations like your garden or garage, in indoor locations with a lot of natural light like near a window, or in locations with no natural light at all, like a cupboard.  

It is okay if you reuse locations and record a training video of one thing on the same surface as the training video of another thing. What is important is that you do not record multiple training videos of the same thing in the same environment. If your things can be easily moved, you can speed up the process by taking several things at once to one location and then taking a training video of each separately before moving them all to the next environment. 

If the items you choose cannot be moved to different environments because they are too large or they are immovable, don’t worry. We’ll give you [specific instructions](#training-videos-for-large-or-immobile-things) for how to deal with these items. 

## The ORBIT Camera app  

The app has two main screens. The first, called the _Things list screen_, is a list of the things that you will take videos of. Selecting one of those things will take you to the second screen, called the _Thing record and review screen_. This is where you record the videos of that thing.  

The things list will be empty on your first use. To add something, select the _Thing name_ text field and enter a name. Once named, you will be taken to the record and review screen. On this screen you choose whether you want the training or testing video collections for this thing, then add videos to that collection. You can also review, re-record, and delete these videos. Here is how the screen is structured: 

1. Buttons for _Train_, _Zoom Out Test_, and _Pan Test_ video collections. Activate to add that kind of videos, or review ones you have already taken. 

2. Add new video button. Brings up the camera controls. Bringing up the camera controls will provide a record button that will start and stop a recording. Upon stop, the camera controls will dismiss and the video will be selected in the video review selector. 

3. Video review selector. Adjust to change the video detailed in the rest of the screen, as follows. 

4. Video recorded date. 

5. Re-record video button. If you wish to re-record, activate to bring up the camera controls. 

6. Orbit dataset status: uploaded. The app will attempt to upload the video to our online repository. The app uses iOS’s built-in background uploading, which will typically wait for power and Wi-Fi before uploading. 

7. Orbit dataset status: checked. We need to check that each video is appropriate. 

8. Orbit dataset status: published. At the end of the data collection period, the ORBIT dataset will be created from our online repository and published. At this point of publishing, any further changes in your app will not change what has been published. 

9. Delete video button. Removes this video from the thing's collection. If the video has not yet been published, this will delete the video from your device and our online repository. Once published, this will only delete the video from your device. 

 

You can freely navigate between the _Things list screen_ and the _Thing record and review screen_ for each of those things. This means you can add things, and videos of any of those things, as opportunities arise. You do not have to add all the videos for a thing in one go. 

Each screen has a button that brings up a sheet with more information. The _Things list screen_ has _App info_ button that brings up a sheet with this text. The _Thing record and review screen_ has a help button that should bring you to the relevant recording videos instructions. 



## Recording videos with the ORBIT Camera app 

Once you have chosen your things and identified your surfaces and locations, you are ready to start recording your videos! You will record two types of videos of your things - [training](#training-videos) and [testing](#testing-videos) videos.

### Training videos

Let’s first talk about training videos. Let’s say you want your recognition app to recognise your keys. First, the AI needs to be taught what your keys look like, so you will need to record several training videos of your keys. Importantly, your training videos must meet three criteria: 

1.	Each training video should record only one thing at a time. There should be no other objects in the background or on the same surface as the keys.  
2. Each training video must show the keys in at least six different settings. For example, you might take one training video when the keys are on a kitchen counter, one when they have dropped on the floor, one when they are on the couch, etc.  
3.	Each training video must include views of the keys from different sides.  You will need to think about what parts of the keys are the most identifiable. Do they have a keyring with a particular shape or colour? Maybe you have a whistle on the ring as well. The training video should capture these important parts of the object.   

Let’s get started!

Select one of the three things you’ve chosen to record. If your thing is small-to-medium sized, see the next section on [Training videos for small/medium things](#training-videos-for-smallmedium-things). If your thing is larger or cannot be moved, see the section after that, [Training videos for large or immobile things](#training-videos-for-large-or-immobile-things). You will need to record videos for each of your things in two different environments. 

#### Training videos for small/medium things

Follow these step-by-step instructions on how to record a training video of a small to medium sized item. that you can move around. A small to medium sized item can be your mug, your keys, your headphones or anything smaller than the distance from your elbow to your fingertips. These are just examples – feel free to select any other small to medium sized item. You will need to record videos for each of your things in six different environments inside or outside of your house. Remember each environment must be different, so that the app can learn to recognise your things when they are in different places! 

##### Step 1. Go to your selected environment.

Go to where you want to film your thing and clear it so nothing else is on the surface. 

##### Step 2. Position your thing on the clear surface.

Place your thing on the surface, about an arm’s length away from you. Placing the object an arm’s length away will help you keep it in frame when filming. 

##### Step 3. Open the ORBIT Camera app.  

If you want to record a new thing, enter the name of thing in the text field and either select _Go_ on the keyboard or activate the _Add thing_ button. Otherwise, if you have already added that thing to the library, you can select that thing from the list. On creating or selecting the thing, you will be taken to the _Thing record and review screen_. This is to be a _Training_ video, so check _Train_ is selected. If not, activate the button to set the selection. Then activate the _Add new video_ button to bring up the camera controls. 

##### Step 4. Record a video. 

Place one hand on the surface next and very close to your thing. This hand will be your anchor point. This will help you film the thing within the view of the camera and you should always keep this hand next to the thing you are recording. Hold your phone in the other hand and bring it as close as possible to your thing as if you wanted to film it from a very close view. Activate the _Record_ button to begin recording the video. Count slowly to 5 while drawing your phone away from the thing until it reaches your body at about shoulder height. Once your phone touches your body, rotate the item on the surface so that a different side of it is facing you. Bring your phone back to the item and as close to it as possible. Repeat the slow drawing out motion with your phone until it reaches your body at about shoulder height. Repeat this for two more sides of the item, each time rotating the item, so a new side is facing you. Activate the record button again to stop recording. The camera controls will be dismissed. You can re-record the video if you are unhappy how it went. In voiceover, swipe left for the _Add new video_ button, and swipe right for the re-record button.

#### Training videos for large or immobile things

If your thing is large or immobile, you might not be able to rotate it or move it to different places to record your videos. Therefore, you will have to take all these training videos in one place, but rather than rotating your item around on a surface, you will move yourself around your large or immovable item. You will record multiple videos, each taken from a different position or angle facing your thing.  

Follow these step-by-step instructions on how to record a training video of a large sized or immovable item: 

##### Step 1. Go to your selected environment. 

Go to the place that your thing is in and, if possible, remove all the other things around it so nothing else is being filmed. 

##### Step 2. Determine three different positions that face your large or immovable thing. 

A door is much larger than a set of keys, but like the keys, certain parts of the door make it recognisable as this specific door. Take a few seconds to identify three important parts of your large or immovable thing. If your thing does not have three parts that are physically separate, for example a wall plug, simply choose three different angles to face your thing. For example, one facing it directly, another facing it from two steps to the left, and another from two steps to the right. Videos that show your thing from different angles will be useful for the recognition app to learn to recognise it. 

##### Step 3. Open the ORBIT Camera App. 

This step is the same as for small or medium things. If you want to record a new thing, enter the name of thing in the text field and either select _Go_ on the keyboard or activate the _Add thing_ button. Otherwise, if you have already added that thing to the library, you can select that thing from the list. On creating or selecting the thing, you will be taken to the _Thing record and review screen_. This is to be a _Training_ video, so check _Train_ is selected. If not, activate the button to set the selection. Then activate the _Add new video_ button to bring up the camera controls. 

##### Step 4.  Record a video from position one. 

Start by facing your item’s first important part or, if your thing doesn’t have physically separate parts, simply face your thing from the first angle you identified. Reach out and place one hand near or on this position. This hand will be your anchor point. You should try to point the lens on the back of your phone towards this anchor point while recording.  This will help you film the thing within the view of the camera and you should always keep this hand next to the thing you are recording. Hold your phone in the other hand and bring it as close as possible to your thing. Activate the _Record_ button to start recording the video. Keeping your hand on or next to your thing, count slowly to 5 while drawing your phone away from that anchor point until it reaches your body at about shoulder height. Now, keeping your phone steady against your body, take two small steps backwards if it is safe to do so. Activate the _Record_ button again to stop recording. The camera controls will be dismissed. You can re-record the video if you are unhappy how it went. 

##### Step 5. Repeat recording from position two, and then from position three.

### Testing videos

Now let’s talk about testing videos. We call these testing videos because we will use them to test our AI algorithms to see how well they are working in real-life scenarios. To do this, you will need to place each of your things on a surface where there are at least five other objects and then take a video of the whole scene. This will help us test the AI to see if it can find and recognise your things in a more realistic setting. 

Because we want this to be as realistic as possible, you will need to record a video of your thing on a surface where you commonly look for it.  You will need to construct a realistic scene by arranging your thing and at least five other objects on this same surface. This might be tricky sometimes but try to do your best to make it as realistic as possible. These other objects could be some of your ten things or completely different items. For immovable objects like your front door, try to position some likely objects around or in front of it, such as packages, umbrellas, or shoes. When you are arranging your scene, try to imagine how your thing might be placed with the other objects by someone who doesn’t know your habits. Remember, the more realistic your arrangement of different objects together with your thing, the better. The point is to create a realistic scene where we can test if the app would find your thing even among other stuff.  

There are two kinds of testing videos: [zoom out](#how-to-record-a-zoom-out-testing-video) and [pan](#how-to-record-a-pan-testing-video). We would like you to record at least one of each for your things. 

#### How to record a zoom out testing video

The first type of testing video is called _Zoom out test_ and uses a similar technique to the training videos. You will need take one zoom out testing video for each of your things. 

##### Step 1. Select one of your things.

##### Step 2. Find an environment to record your video. 

Go to a surface or location where you would regularly place or look for your thing. For large or immovable things go to the location where your item is. 

##### Step 3. Construct a realistic scene with your thing and other objects. 

For more information on how this scene should look, read the [Testing videos section](#testing-videos) on arranging the scene with other objects. 

##### Step 4. Open the ORBIT Camera App. 

This step is the same as for training videos, except you need to ensure _Zoom out test_ is selected. If you want to record a new thing, enter the name of thing in the text field and either select _Go_ on the keyboard or activate the _Add thing_ button. Otherwise, if you have already added that thing to the library, you can select that thing from the list. On creating or selecting the thing, you will be taken to the _Thing record and review screen_. This is to be a _Zoom out test_ video, so check _Zoom out test_ is selected. If not, activate the button to set the selection. Then activate the _Add new video_ button to bring up the camera controls. 

##### Step 5. Record a video of your scene. 

Start by facing your scene. Reach out and place one hand in your scene. If your scene is on a surface, place your hand on the edge of the surface. If your scene contains a large or immovable thing, place your hand somewhere random on that item or at a random angle. This hand will be your anchor point. You should try to point the lens on the back of your phone towards this anchor point while recording.  This will help you film the thing within the view of the camera. Holding your phone in your other hand, bring your phone as close as possible to your anchor point with the camera pointed towards your scene. Activate the _Record_ button to start recording the video. Now, keeping your anchor hand fixed, count slowly to 5 while drawing your phone toward you and away from that anchor point until it reaches your body. Once you have reached your body, activate the record button again to stop recording. The camera controls will be dismissed. You can re-record the video if you are unhappy how it went. 

Repeat these five steps for each of your things! 

#### How to record a pan testing video

The second type of testing video is called _Pan test_. You will need to take one pan testing video for each of your things. 

##### Step 1. Select one of your things.

##### Step 2. Find an environment to record your video. 

Go to a surface or location where you would regularly place or look for your thing. For large or immovable things, go to the location where your item is. 

##### Step 3. Construct a realistic scene with your thing and other objects. 

For more information on how this scene should look, read the [Testing videos section](#testing-videos) on arranging the scene with other objects. 

##### Step 4. Open the ORBIT App.

This step is the same as before, except you need to ensure _Pan test_ is selected. If you want to record a new thing, enter the name of thing in the text field and either select _Go_ on the keyboard or activate the _Add thing_ button. Otherwise, if you have already added that thing to the library, you can select that thing from the list. On creating or selecting the thing, you will be taken to the _Thing record and review screen_. This is to be a _Pan test_ video, so check _Pan test_ is selected. If not, activate the button to set the selection. Then activate the _Add new video_ button to bring up the camera controls. 

##### Step 5. Record a video of your scene. 

Start by facing your scene. Try to make sure your selected thing is not directly in front of you. You will now record a video while panning over this scene from right to left. Hold your phone at around shoulder height pointing to your scene. To help you do that, you can reach out and place one hand in your scene briefly to use as an anchor point to aim the lens on the back of your phone at the scene while recording. Withdraw your anchor hand. Then turn your head and shoulders to the right and turn the camera to face the same direction as you. Activate the _Record_ button to start recording the video. Now, slowly turn your head and shoulders to the left while you pan your phone in the same direction. Try to keep your phone steady as you move it in a straight line from right to left. Remember, in a real-life situation, the app will not know where your thing is, so do not give it any hints by zooming in or stopping the camera when you pan over your thing. When you reach the left side of your scene, activate the record button again to stop recording. The camera controls will be dismissed. You can re-record the video if you are unhappy how it went.

Repeat these five steps for each of your things! 

## What happens after recording? 

When you end your recording, the video will automatically be uploaded to the ORBIT server. We will then check your videos to make sure that they don’t have any information in them that could reveal your identity. We will also check if the video you took is appropriate for this research project. For example, we will check if we can see the thing you have named in the video and if you have reported the correct type of video, _train_, _zoom out_ test or _pan test_. If there are problems, we will ask you to record more videos of your thing. If your videos pass that check they will be added to the final dataset which will be made public after the study ends. You can delete or re-record any of your videos until the end of the study.
