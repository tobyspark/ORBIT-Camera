# Recording your videos with the ORBIT Camera app

You will collect two kinds of videos for each of your 5 things: training videos for teaching the AI algorithm to recognise the thing, and testing videos for testing the performance of the AI algorithm. Before you begin using the ORBIT Camera app, it is highly recommended that you complete our [tutorial](https://orbit.city.ac.uk/phase-2-data-collection/#Tutorial
) to learn the technique to record your videos. You will be using one of your hands as a reference point to make sure the things you record are in frame because if you point your camera towards your hand there’s a good chance that the thing you record is also captured.  

#### Step 1. Think of a thing and enter it into the app.
In the ORBIT Camera App home screen, enter the name of your thing and hit the Add thing button. A thing is any item that you regularly need to find or identify. It could be an item that easily gets moved or misplaced, or an item that is difficult or inconvenient to identify by touch alone. If you are stuck for ideas, see the [FAQ](https://orbit.city.ac.uk/phase-2-data-collection/#FAQs
) for a list of things other people have collected. 

### Step 2. Record 2 testing videos of the thing.

#### Step 2.1. Go to the thing. 
Go to wherever you would normally keep the thing. Capture a testing video of your thing and all the things around it - the whole scene. It is important that this video includes other things that are usually there. For example, if your keys are on your desk, the scene is the whole desk and includes lamp, books etc.

#### Step 2.2. Navigate to a new testing video in the app.
From your Things list screen, either enter a name for your thing or select your thing from the list. This will bring up the Thing record and review screen. Make sure you’re in the correct test video slot by swiping up or down in the recording slots. You are now ready to record a testing video!

#### Step 2.3. Record a testing video of your thing in the whole scene.
Place one hand anywhere on your scene, for example, at the edge of the surface, to act as a reference point, and keep it there. Holding the phone in your other hand, bring your phone as close as possible to your reference hand with the camera pointed towards your scene. Use the Record button to start recording the video. Now, draw your phone away from the anchored hand until it reaches your chest. Once you have reached your chest, click the record button again to stop recording. The testing video should last 15 seconds. A tic sound and a vibration will play every 5 seconds and a double tic sound and a strong vibration will play when 15 seconds are up. After this, your recording will automatically stop and your video will be uploaded to the server. From your thing’s Record screen, make sure train is selected, and click the Add new video button to bring up the camera controls. 

#### Step 2.4. Repeat from a different position.
Face your scene from a different position. Take a second testing video following the guidelines in the previous steps.

### Step 3. Record 5 training videos of the thing

#### Step 3.1. Take your thing to a new surface with no other objects on it.
You may have to move other things to ensure this. Examples could be a cleared kitchen counter, work desk, or coffee table. Place your thing on the surface, about an arm’s length away from you. This will help you keep it in frame when recording. 

#### Step 3.2. Navigate to a new training video in the app.
From your Things list screen, either enter a name for your thing or select your thing from the list. This will bring up the Thing record and review screen. Make sure you’re in the correct train video slot by swiping up or down in the recording slots. You are now ready to record a training video!

#### Step 3.3. Record a training video of your thing.
Like with the testing video, place one hand on the surface, very close to your thing. Holding the phone in your other hand, bring your phone as close as possible to your reference hand with the camera pointed towards your scene. Use the Record button to start recording the video. Now, draw your phone away from the anchored hand until it reaches your chest. Then, rotate the thing on the surface so that a different side is facing you. Bring your phone close to the thing again, and then slowly draw it away towards your chest. Repeat this for 2 more sides of the thing, and then click the Record button to stop the recording. In total, a training video should be about 25 seconds. A tic sound and a vibration will play every 5 seconds to help you time your recording. You should hear a tic sound and a vibration every time you have moved the phone to your chest. You will hear a double tic sound and a stronger vibration when 25 seconds is up. When you reach 30 seconds your recording will automatically stop and your video will be uploaded to the server. 

#### Step 3.4. Repeat on another 4 surfaces.
Move your object to a new clear surface, and take another training video. Repeat this for 4 completely different clear surfaces. 

### Step 4. Repeat these steps to take testing and training videos for at least 5 things.

## After recording
When you finish your recordings, the videos will automatically be uploaded to the ORBIT online repository. We will then check your videos and the thing names to make sure that they don’t have any information in them that could reveal your identity or contain anything explicit or offensive. Once your videos pass our checks, they will be added to the final dataset which will be made public after the study ends. Going through each thing you’ve created in the main thing list screen tells you whether you have completed all videos for that thing, and whether any videos are still waiting to be checked by the research team. If a video includes any personal identified information or the thing is not visible in the video, you should receive a notification to re-record your video. You can delete or re-record any of your videos until the end of the study.  When all your videos are completed and checked, you will receive a notification to delete the videos and the app.
