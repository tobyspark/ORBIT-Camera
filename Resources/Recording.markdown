Once you have chosen your things and identified your surfaces and locations, you are ready to start recording your videos! You will record two types of videos of your things - [training](#training-videos) and [testing](#testing-videos) videos.

## Training videos

Let’s first talk about training videos. Let’s say you want your recognition app to recognise your keys. First, the A.I. needs to be taught what your keys look like, so you will need to record several training videos of your keys. Importantly, your training videos must meet three criteria:  

1.	Each training video should record only one thing at a time. There should be no other objects in the background or on the same surface as the keys. 
2. Each training video must show the keys in at least six different settings. For example, you might take one training video when the keys are on a kitchen counter, one when they have dropped on the floor, one when they are on the couch, etc.    
3.	When filming your keys, you must rotate them around on the surface to show them from different sides. You will need to think about what parts of the keys are the most identifiable. Do they have a keyring? Maybe you have a whistle on the ring as well. The way you will do this will differ depending on the size of your selected item and is explained in detail in the two following sections.     

Let’s get started!

Select one of the three things you’ve chosen to record. If your thing is small-to-medium sized, see the next section on [Training videos for small/medium things](#training-videos-for-smallmedium-things). If your thing is larger or cannot be moved, see the section after that, [Training videos for large or immovable things](#training-videos-for-large-or-immovable-things).

### Training videos for small/medium things

Follow these step-by-step instructions on how to record a training video of a small to medium sized item that you can move around. A small to medium sized item can be your mug, your keys, your headphones or anything smaller than the distance from your elbow to your fingertips. These are just examples – feel free to select any other small to medium sized item. You will need to record videos for each of your things in six different environments inside or outside of your house. Remember each environment must be different, so that the app can learn to recognise your things when they are in different places!   

#### Step 1. Go to your selected environment.

Go to where you want to film your thing and clear it so nothing else is on the surface. 

#### Step 2. Position your thing on the clear surface.

Place your thing on the surface, about an arm’s length away from you. Placing the object an arm’s length away will help you keep it in frame when filming.   

#### Step 3. Open the ORBIT Camera app.  

If you want to record a new thing, enter the name of your thing in the text field and either select _Go_ on the keyboard or use the _Add thing button_. If you have already added your thing to the library, simply select it from your Things list. You will then be taken to the _Thing record and review screen_. Since this is a _Training video_, check that _Train_ is selected. If not, use the Train button to set the selection. Then select the _Add new video_ button to bring up the camera controls. 

#### Step 4. Record a video. 

Place one hand on the surface next and very close to your thing. You should keep this hand here while recording as an anchor point for where your object is on the surface. This will help you aim your camera at your thing. Hold your phone in the other hand and bring it as close as possible to your thing as if you wanted to film it from a very close view. Use the Record button to begin recording the video. A tic sound will start to play every 5 seconds to help you time your recording. Slowly draw your phone away from the thing until it reaches your body at about shoulder height and you hear one tic sound. Then rotate the item on its surface so that a different side of it is facing you. Bring your phone back to the item and as close to it as possible. Repeat the slow drawing out motion with your phone until it reaches your body at about shoulder height. Repeat this for two more sides of the item, each time rotating the item, so a new side is facing you. Each side should be recorded for about 5 seconds, which is the time between two tics. Use the record button again to stop recording. The camera controls will be dismissed. You can re-record the video if you are unhappy with it. In voiceover, swipe left for the _Add new video_ button, and swipe right for the _re-record_ button.

### Training videos for large or immovable things

If your thing is large or immovable, you might not be able to rotate it or move it to different places to record your videos. You will instead take all its training videos in one place, but rather than rotating your item around on a surface, you will move yourself around your large or immovable item. You will record multiple videos, each taken from a different position or angle facing your thing.  You will need to repeat this technique 2 times for each of your large or immovable things. 

Follow these step-by-step instructions on how to record a training video of a large sized or immovable item:  

#### Step 1. Go to your selected environment. 

Go to the place that your thing is in and, if possible, remove all the other things around it so nothing else is being filmed. 

#### Step 2. Determine three different positions that face your large or immovable thing. 

A door is much larger than a set of keys, but like the keys, certain parts of the door make it recognisable as this specific door. Take a few seconds to identify three important parts of your large or immovable thing. If your thing does not have three parts that are physically separate, for example a wall plug, simply choose three different angles to face your thing. For example, one facing it directly, another facing it from two steps to the left, and another from two steps to the right. Videos that show your thing from different angles will be useful for the recognition app to learn to recognise it. 

#### Step 3. Open the ORBIT Camera App. 

This step is the same as for small or medium things. If you want to record a new thing, enter the name of your thing in the text field and either select _Go_ on the keyboard or use the _Add thing_ button. If you have already added your thing to the library, simply select it from your Things list. You will then be taken to the _Thing record and review screen_. Since this is a Training video, check that _Train_ is selected. If not, use the _Train_ button to set the selection. Then use the _Add new video_ button to bring up the camera controls. 

#### Step 4.  Record a video from position one. 

Start by facing your item’s first important part or, if your thing doesn’t have physically separate parts, simply face your thing from the first angle you identified. Reach out and place one hand near or on your thing. You should keep this hand here while recording as an anchor point. This will help you aim your camera at your thing. Hold your phone in the other hand and bring it as close as possible to your thing. Use the Record button to start recording the video. A tic sound will start to play every 5 seconds to help you time your recording. Keeping your anchored hand fixed, draw your phone away from your thing until it reaches your body at about shoulder height and you hear one tic sound. Now, keeping your phone steady against your body, take two small steps backwards if it is safe to do so. This should take another one tic. Use the _Record_ button again to stop recording. The camera controls will be dismissed. You can re-record the video if you are unhappy with it.

#### Step 5. Repeat recording from position two, and then from position three.

Then take a second set of videos from each of the 3 positions. This should give you 6 videos of your large or immovable thing. 

## Testing videos

Now let’s talk about testing videos. We call these testing videos because we will use them to test our A.I. algorithms to see how well they are working in real-life scenarios. To do this, you will need to place each of your things on a surface where there are at least five other objects and then take a video of the whole scene. This will help us test the A.I. to see if it can find and recognise your things in a more realistic setting.  

Because we want this to be as realistic as possible, you will need to record a video of your thing on a surface where you commonly look for it.  You will need to construct a realistic scene by arranging your thing and at least five other objects on this same surface. These other objects could be some of your ten things or completely different items. For immovable objects like your front door, try to position some likely objects around or in front of it, such as packages, umbrellas, or shoes. When you are arranging your scene, try to imagine how your thing might be placed with the other objects by someone who doesn’t know your habits. This might be tricky but try to do your best. Remember, the more realistic your arrangement of different objects together with your thing, the better. The point is to create a scene where we can test if the app would find your thing even among other stuff.

There are two kinds of testing videos: [zoom out](#how-to-record-a-zoom-out-testing-video) and [pan](#how-to-record-a-pan-testing-video). We would like you to record both testing videos for each of your things. 

### How to record a “Zoom out” testing video  

The first type of testing video is called a Zoom out testing video and uses a similar technique to the training videos. You will need take one Zoom out testing video for each of your things.  

#### Step 1. Select one of your things.

#### Step 2. Find an environment to record your video. 

Go to a surface or location where you would regularly place or look for your thing. For large or immovable things, go to the location where your item is. 

#### Step 3. Construct a realistic scene with your thing and other objects. 

For more information on how this scene should look, read the [Testing videos section](#testing-videos) on arranging the scene with other objects. 

#### Step 4. Open the ORBIT Camera App. 

This step is the same as for training videos, except you need to ensure Zoom out test is selected. If you want to record a new thing, enter the name of your thing in the text field and either select _Go_ on the keyboard or use the _Add thing_ button. If you have already added your thing to the library, simply select it from your Things list. You will then be taken to the _Thing record and review screen_. Since this is a Zoom out testing video, check that _Zoom out test_ is selected. If not, use the _Zoom out test_ button to set the selection. Then use the _Add new video button_ to bring up the camera controls. 

#### Step 5. Record a video of your scene. 

Start by facing your scene. Reach out and place one hand in your scene. If your scene is on a surface, place your hand on the edge of the surface. If your scene contains a large or immovable thing, place your hand somewhere random on that item or at a random angle. You should keep this hand here while recording as an anchor point. This will help you aim your camera at your scene. Holding your phone in your other hand, bring your phone as close as possible to your anchored hand with the camera pointed towards your scene. Use the _Record_ button to start recording the video. A tic sound will start to play every 5 seconds to help you time your recording. Now, keeping your anchored hand fixed, draw your phone away from the anchored hand until it reaches your body and you hear one tic sound. Once you have reached your body, use the _record_ button again to stop recording. The camera controls will be dismissed. You can re-record the video if you are unhappy with it. 

Repeat these five steps for each of your things! 

### How to record a “Pan” testing video  

The second type of testing video is called a Pan testing video. You will need to take one pan testing video for each of your things.  

#### Step 1. Select one of your things.

#### Step 2. Find an environment to record your video. 

Go to a surface or location where you would regularly place or look for your thing. For large or immovable things, go to the location where your item is. 

#### Step 3. Construct a realistic scene with your thing and other objects. 

For more information on how this scene should look, read the [Testing videos section](#testing-videos) on arranging the scene with other objects. 

#### Step 4. Open the ORBIT Camera App.

This step is the same as before, except you need to ensure _Pan test_ is selected. If you want to record a new thing, enter the name of your thing in the text field and either select _Go_ on the keyboard or use the _Add thing button_. If you have already added your thing to the library, simply select it from your Things list. You will then be taken to the _Thing record and review screen_. Since this is a Pan testing video, check that _Pan test_ is selected. If not, use the _Pan test_ button to set the selection. Then use the _Add new video_ button to bring up the camera controls. 

#### Step 5. Record a video of your scene. 

Start by facing your scene. Try to make sure your selected thing is not directly in front of you. You will now record a video while panning over this scene from right to left. Hold your phone at around shoulder height pointing to your scene. To help you do this, you can reach out and place one hand in your scene briefly as an anchor point to help you aim your camera at the scene. Withdraw your anchor hand. Then turn your head and shoulders to the right and turn the camera to face the same direction as you. Use the _Record_ button to start recording the video. A tic sound will start to play every 5 seconds to help you time your recording. Now, slowly turn your head and shoulders to the left while you pan your phone in the same direction. Try to keep your phone steady as you move it in a straight line from right to left. When you reach the left side of your scene, use the _record_ button again to stop recording. The camera controls will be dismissed. You can re-record the video if you are unhappy with it.

Repeat these five steps for each of your things! 

## What happens after recording? 

When you end your recordings, the videos will automatically be uploaded to the ORBIT online repository. We will then check your videos to make sure that they don’t have any information in them that could reveal your identity. We will also check if the video you took and the label of that video are appropriate for this research project. For example, we will check that the thing you recorded is present in the video. If there are any problems with a video, we will ask you to re-record it. Once your videos pass our checks, they will be added to the final dataset which will be made public after the study ends. You can delete or re-record any of your videos until the end of the study.
