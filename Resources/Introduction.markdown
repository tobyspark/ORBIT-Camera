# Introduction

Hello and welcome to the ORBIT dataset project! 

We are collecting a dataset to help develop AI recognition apps that will use your mobile phone's camera to find and identify the things that are important to you. For example, has someone moved your house keys? Do you regularly need to identify specific items while out shopping? What about your guide cane - have you forgotten where you put it, or gotten it confused with someone else’s? Maybe you want to recognise the door of a friend’s house? Imagine if you did not have to know exactly where your things were in order to find or identify them again. 

To build these recognition apps, a large dataset of videos taken by blind and visually impaired users is needed. As part of the ORBIT dataset project, you will be asked to take multiple videos of at least ten things that are meaningful to you or that you regularly need to find or identify. We will combine these videos with submissions from other ORBIT contributors to form a large dataset of different objects. This dataset can then be used to develop new AI algorithms to help build apps that will work for blind and visually impaired users all over the world. 

This document includes step-by-step instructions for how to use this app to record videos of different objects in a way that will help us build new AI systems. Because taking videos that can be used for developing AI can be tricky for blind users, these instructions are fairly detailed. Please read them carefully and feel free to revisit the different sections of this guide as often as you need.
