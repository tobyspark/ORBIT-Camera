## How to collect data for the ORBIT dataset project?

Hello and welcome to the ORBIT dataset project! Thank you for joining blind and low vision people across the world to create a large dataset of videos. The first use of this dataset will be to build an app like Seeing A.I. that uses artificial intelligence, abbreviated to A.I., and your phone’s camera to identify things that are important to you, not just generic things. For example, your keys that are no longer where you put them or a friend’s car that is parked somewhere in front of your house.  

To contribute, you will be asked to take several short videos of five things that are important to you. To make sure our algorithms ultimately work for blind and low vision people, it is really important that the videos comes from you and not from sighted helpers. Below are instructions which will help you to take good videos. You can expect to spend about 2 hours reading the instructions and then recording the videos.  

Participants who record all their videos at once found it easier to complete their contribution. A donation will be made to a charity of your choice after you submit 5 complete things during our data collection period.

## How does A.I. work?

Before you begin taking videos, it might help to understand how they will be used. Apps like Seeing A.I. use Artificial Intelligence, or A.I., to automatically recognise the things users record with their phone camera. To do this, these A.I. algorithms have to be “taught” what to look for by analysing videos of the things you want it to recognise – these are calling training videos. A.I. algorithms learn best when each training video shows each object on its own from different angles and in different locations. This helps the algorithm learn what is important and what to ignore. Once the algorithm has learned to recognise a thing, we need to test its ability to find that thing in a realistic place and in amongst other things, like keys on a bookshelf. We call this a scene. For us to be able to test the A.I., we need you to record the testing videos.   

# Collecting videos with the ORBIT Camera app

## Choosing your things

Your first task is to decide what you would like the A.I. to learn about. To do this, you should choose at least ten things that are important to you. They can be items you regularly need to find or identify, items that easily get misplaced, or items that are difficult to identify by touch alone. For example, your house keys, your backpack, a tin of food, your guide cane, or a wristwatch. Also consider large or immovable things that you might want to recognise. For example, a friend’s door, a car, a colleagues’ desk, a specific setting on a household appliance, or a wall plug. We suggest that at least 2 of your 10 things are large or immovable.

## Choosing where to record

Your next task is to choose at least six different places where you will record the training videos for the things you can move around. It is important that each of these locations is different so that the app can learn to recognise your things when they are in different places! This can mean surfaces in different rooms of your house, in different corners of the same room, in a public space like a library, in outdoor locations like your garden or garage, in indoor locations with a lot of natural light like near a window, or in locations with no natural light at all, like a cupboard.

It is okay if you reuse locations and record a training video of one thing on the same surface as the training video of another thing. What is important is that you do not record multiple training videos of the same thing in the same locations. If your things can be easily moved, you can speed up the process by taking several things at once to one location and then taking a training video of each separately before moving them all to the next location.

If the items you choose cannot be moved to different locations because they are too large or they are immovable, don’t worry. We’ll give you specific instructions for how to deal with these items. 

## Navigating the ORBIT Camera app 

The app has two main screens. The first is called the _Things list screen_ and is a list of the things you have chosen to video. If you select one of your things, you will be taken to a second screen called the _Thing record and review screen_. This is where you can record videos of that thing. 

Your Things list will be empty on your first use. To add something, select the _Thing name_ text field and type a name. When you click _Go_ or the _Add thing_ button, you will be taken to the _record and review screen_. On this screen you can choose whether you want the training or testing video collections for this thing, and then add videos to that collection. You can also review, re-record, and delete these videos. Here is how the screen is structured: 

1. Buttons for _Train_, _Zoom Out Test_, and _Pan Test_ video collections. Use these buttons to add that kind of video, or review ones you have already taken. 

2. Add new video button. Brings up the camera controls. Bringing up the camera controls will provide a record button that can be used to start and stop a recording. Upon stop, the camera controls will dismiss and the video will be selected in the video review selector. There will be a tic sound every 5 seconds to help you time your recording. 

3. Video review selector. Brings up the videos you have already taken. Adjust to change the video detailed in the rest of the screen, as follows. 

4. Video recorded date. 

5. Re-record video button. If you wish to re-record, use the _re-record_ button to bring up the camera controls. 

6. Orbit dataset status:Once the app has uploaded the video to our online repository, this status will say _uploaded_ The app needs power and Wi-Fi to upload your videos.

7. Orbit dataset status:Once we have checked that your video is appropriate, this status will say _checked_.

8. Orbit dataset status:Once the ORBIT dataset has been created and published, this status will say _published_. Once published, any further changes in your app will not be registered. 

9. Delete video button. Removes this video from your thing’s video collection. If the video has not yet been published, this will delete the video from your device and our online repository. Once published, this will only delete the video from your device.

You can freely navigate between the _Things list screen_ and the _Thing record and review screen_ for each of your things. This means you can add things, and videos of any of those things, as opportunities arise. You do not have to add all the videos for a thing in one go.

Each screen has a button that brings up a sheet with more information. The _Things list screen_ has an _ORBIT instructions_ button that brings up a sheet with this text. The _Thing record and review screen_ has a _Recording instructions_ button that brings up the relevant recording instructions.
