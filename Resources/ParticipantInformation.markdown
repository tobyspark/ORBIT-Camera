# Participant information

We would like to invite you to take part in a research study. Before you decide whether you would like to take part it is important that you understand why the research is being done and what it would involve for you. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. You will be given a copy of this information sheet to keep.

## The study

Name: Phase 1 study ORBIT dataset - metalearning for personalised object recognition aimed at visually impaired people

Principal investigator: Dr Simone Stumpf

REC reference number: ETH1920-0331 City, University of London

## What is the purpose of the study?

Smartphones are really useful in making visual information accessible to visually impaired people. For instance, the SeeingAI app allows you to take a picture of your surroundings and then it reads aloud common things that are recognised in the picture, for example “a person sitting on a sofa”.

The problem is that while these kinds of AI currently can say “this is a mug”, they can’t tell you which of your mugs is which, and they don’t know what a white cane is. We are trying to change this. We want these assistive technologies to work for you, so we are working with people like you to identify what things are important to your everyday life, and figure out how best to get the phone to recognise them. To recognise a particular thing by an app, we need first to show what that thing looks like.

Specifically, the aim of this project is to create a large open dataset of videos taken by visually impaired people. The videos will show things those people judge important in their lives and then the dataset will be used to train AI systems to recognise those things. We made this iPhone app to do this, so that we can involve hundreds or thousands of people. 

## Why have I been invited to take part?

You have been invited to participate in this study as a registered blind adult living in the UK. 

## Do I have to take part?

Participation in the study is voluntary, and you can choose not to participate in part or all of the project. You can withdraw at any stage of the project without being penalised or disadvantaged in any way. If you decide to not take part in the study, your contact information and any data collected will be permanently deleted. It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to take part you will be asked to complete a consent form. If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw at any time and without giving a reason.

## What will happen if I take part? What do I have to do?

You will use the app to film short videos of 10 objects you might like your phone to recognise. You will take around 80 of these videos using different filming techniques and in different locations. After taking a video you will upload it to the ORBIT server for approval. If the video doesn’t include any personal identifying information, it will be added to the open dataset. Otherwise, you will get notified via email and kindly asked to take another video of the same object. With setup and reviewing the data we anticipate that the overall time that you will spend collecting data over the study period is no longer than 2.5 hours.

## What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?

This study is completely confidential, and we have identified no reasonably foreseeable risks of harm, safety, or side effects to you as a result of taking part in this study. You may find it difficult to record the videos and share them with us. To reduce those risks, we provide simple step-by-step instructions, and you can tell us at any point if it’s not working for you. 

## What are the possible benefits of taking part?

Your participation in this research is appreciated and you will receive a £50 Amazon voucher after submitting 80 videos of your selected objects. 

## How is the project being funded?

The project is funded by Microsoft. We have an ‘AI for Accessibility grant’, see ‘Personalized object recognition through AI’ on https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-accessibility-projects?activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr2

## Conflicts of interests

N/A

## What should I do if I want to take part?

If you would like to continue with the study, you will need to give us consent by signing the consent form provided. If you have any questions, get in touch with Lida on the following email address lida.theodorou.2@city.ac.uk

Once you have provided consent you can start using the app.

## Data privacy statement

City, University of London the data controller of this study based in the United Kingdom. This means that we are responsible for looking after your information and using it properly. The legal basis under which your data will be processed is City’s public task. Your right to access, change or move your information are limited, as we need to manage your information in a specific way in order for the research to be reliable and accurate. To safeguard your rights, we will use the minimum personal- identifiable information possible (for further information please see guide to data protection).

City will use your name and contact details to contact you about the research study as necessary. If you wish to receive the results of the study, your contact details will also be kept for this purpose. The only people who will have access to your identifiable information will be the project team, listed at https://orbit.city.ac.uk/team/. City will keep identifiable information about you from this study for 10 years after the study has finished.

You can find out more about how City handles data by visiting https://www.city.ac.uk/about/governance/legal. If you are concerned about how we have processed your personal data, you can contact the Information Commissioner’s Office (IOC) https://ico.org.uk/.

## Will my taking part in the study be kept confidential?

Your participation will be kept confidential and we will take some precautions to guarantee your anonymity:

- Your identity will be kept separate to the data collected for the study. The two will be tied with a randomly chosen participant number so people other than the research team will not be able to link your name with your data.
- All the videos published in the open dataset will be cleared from any personal identifying information such as name, addresses, phone numbers, pictures, QR codes.

## What will happen to the results?

We will use the videos collected by this app to create a large open dataset. The dataset will be used to train AI systems to recognise the things that are important for visually impaired people.

A summarised version of the findings of the study will be posted on the project website at https://orbit.city.ac.uk/. Subsequent to the study, we may report our work, for example through publishing articles in academic journals or speaking at conferences. Anonymised and in the aggregate, all the data from the study may be provided as evidence for our conclusions. If you desire to have a copy of the result, please send a request by email to the researcher.

## Who has reviewed the study?

This study has been approved by City, University of London’s Computer Science Research Ethics Committee.

If you have any problems, concerns or questions about this study, you should ask to speak to a member of the research team. If you remain unhappy and wish to complain formally, you can do this through City’s complaints procedure. To complain about the study, you need to phone 020 7040 3040. You can then ask to speak to the Secretary to Senate Research Ethics Committee and inform them that the name of the project is Phase 1 study ORBIT dataset.
